    "A contingency matrix, also known as a confusion matrix, is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It summarizes the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model on a test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix typically has four entries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- True Positive (TP): The number of instances correctly predicted as positive (belonging to the positive class).\n",
    "- False Positive (FP): The number of instances incorrectly predicted as positive when they actually belong to the negative class.\n",
    "- True Negative (TN): The number of instances correctly predicted as negative (belonging to the negative class).\n",
    "- False Negative (FN): The number of instances incorrectly predicted as negative when they actually belong to the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these four values, several evaluation metrics can be calculated, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and others, to assess the classification model's performance."

    "Pair confusion matrices are useful in multilabel classification because they allow a more fine-grained evaluation of the model's performance when dealing with multiple labels for each instance. They provide insights into the model's ability to predict individual labels correctly and handle label combinations."

Instead of assessing the model's performance on an isolated NLP task, extrinsic measures measure how well the language model performs in real-world applications.\n",

    "In machine learning, an intrinsic measure evaluates the performance of a model based on its performance on an isolated task or a specific aspect of the model. Intrinsic measures are task-specific and do not take into account the model's performance in a broader context or real-world applications.\n",

    "On the other hand, extrinsic measures (as discussed earlier) evaluate the model's performance in the context of a downstream task, measuring its effectiveness in real-world applications. Extrinsic measures are generally more meaningful as they assess the model's utility in practical scenarios."

    "The purpose of a confusion matrix in machine learning is to provide a detailed breakdown of the model's performance on a classification task. It helps in understanding how well the model predicts true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative instances.\n",

    "From the confusion matrix, several evaluation metrics can be derived, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and more. These metrics help identify the strengths and weaknesses of the model in the following ways:\n",

    "- Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model's predictions.\n",
    "- Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, useful when false positives are costly.\n",
    "- Recall: Proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances, useful when false negatives are costly.\n",
    "- F1 score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, provides a balanced measure between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing these metrics, one can identify if the model is biased towards positive or negative classes, whether it has good generalization, or if it is struggling with certain types of misclassifications."

    "Limitations of using accuracy as a sole evaluation metric for classification tasks:\n",

    "- Imbalanced Classes: Accuracy can be misleading when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class dominates the others. A high accuracy might be achieved by simply predicting the majority class while ignoring the minority classes.\n",

    "- Misinterpreting the Results: Accuracy does not reveal the nature of misclassifications, and it treats all errors equally. Misclassification of certain classes might have more significant consequences than others.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Precision, Recall, and F1 Score: These metrics provide insights into the model's performance on individual classes and can handle imbalanced datasets effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ROC-AUC and PR-AUC: These metrics evaluate the model's performance across different decision thresholds and are suitable for imbalanced datasets.\n",

    "- Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, helping to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses.\n",
